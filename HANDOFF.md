# HANDOFF — resume state

Single entry point for picking this up on another machine. Reflects the repo as of the branch that
added this file. **Plan of record:** `DESIGN.md` (north-star) + the `PLAN-*.md` docs; this file is the
*status + how-to-resume* layer on top of them.

---

## 1. Where things stand (one paragraph)

The **server-first app works** and now **matches from a local tile data block** (falling back to
Overpass). The **standalone/serverless browser app is designed but not built** — the design is
`PLAN-APP.md` (staged: south-Overijssel → Benelux → Western Europe; reads only the working-set tiles).
The compute (matcher) runs identically in wasm; the blocker to running it *in a browser* is (a) a loft
regression that aborts all `--native-wasm` execution (**loft#521**) and (b) the browser packaging
toolchain (node + jco + a browser), which wasn't available in the environment this was built in.

---

## 2. What works / is merged to `main`

- **Tile-block matching** — `server/server.loft` binds the block once (`store_persist_bind`) and reads
  its corridor via `tiles_corridor_ways` per request, Overpass fallback when outside coverage. Verified
  live: 811 m / 0 bridges from tiles, no network; warm edits ~40–68 ms.
- **Match-quality instrumentation** (`lib/routing_kernel`) — `match_quality()` emits the PLAN-MATCH §7
  numbers (deviation, bridged length, on-network length, per-metre suitability penalty, road-class mix),
  captured **during assembly** (`assemble_stretch`) since the stitched route isn't a clean edge-walk.
- **Plan docs** — `PLAN-MATCH` (escalation ladder + §7 numbers + §9 mode×intent), `PLAN-ROUTING`
  (get-me-there fork), `PLAN-APP` (the standalone app; §10 concrete steps; §11 data freshness). Plus the
  pre-existing `PLAN`, `PLAN-BROWSER`, `PLAN-TILES`, `DESIGN`.
- **Open-project setup** — `LICENSE` (LGPL-3.0-or-later), `LICENSE.data` (ODbL-1.0 for the blocks), SPDX
  headers on our sources, `ATTRIBUTION.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — builds binaries (server + wasm client) and runs `make test` on
  every PR/push. The wasm-parity *run* is non-blocking (loft#521).
- **Data-refresh workflow** (`.github/workflows/data-refresh.yml`) — monthly, **dormant** until
  `tools/build-blocks.sh` exists (see §5).
- **Pipeline tools** — `tools/gen-tiles.loft` (block generator) + `tools/geojson2overpass.py`
  (converter), rescued from scratch so the data pipeline is portable.

## 3. Open PRs

- **#8** `ci-wasm-note` — corrects the CI comment to point at loft#521 (my first note wrongly blamed
  "wasmtime 46"). Safe to merge when green.
- **(this)** `handoff` — this file + the rescued pipeline tools.

## 4. External dependency states (loft) — the real gating

| issue | what | state | effect here |
|---|---|---|---|
| loft#511 | collection capture into closures | **FIXED (merged)** | unblocked the server binding the block into the event loop |
| loft#513 | store re-init (bind reads full data) | **FIXED (merged)** | **⚠ changed the on-disk store format** — `.tiles` written by pre-fix loft read *empty*; regenerate with current loft |
| loft-libs-net #517 | HTTP range/bytes/headers/size stack | **implemented on branch `tuxedo-517-http-stack`, NOT merged** | needed for browser working-set **range reads** (Benelux+, PLAN-APP Track 2) |
| **loft#521** | `--native-wasm` aborts at runtime (#518 spawns a main-stack thread wasip2 can't create) | **OPEN**, triaged `sev:high`/`wa:partial`/`area:codegen`, **no fix yet** | **blocks running ANY wasm** — Track 1 (browser) and Track C's "prove under wasmtime" run step. Workaround: build loft **pre-#518** for wasm runs. wasm *build*, native, server are unaffected. |

Watch loft `main` / branches for a #521 fix; when it lands, flip the CI wasm gate back to blocking.

## 5. The tile data + how to regenerate it

- The block **`soverijssel.tiles`** (21 MB, southern-Overijssel, 1215 tiles) is **gitignored** (`*.tiles`)
  — it does not travel. The server matches from it if present in the launch dir, else Overpass.
- **It must be regenerated with the current loft** (loft#513 format change). Pipeline (now in `tools/`):

  ```sh
  # 1. Geofabrik extract → highways only → GeoJSON-seq (LineStrings + tags)
  osmium tags-filter <region>.osm.pbf w/highway -o roads.pbf
  osmium export roads.pbf -f geojsonseq -o roads.geojsonseq
  # 2. → Overpass-JSON shape that parse_ways/gen-tiles consume
  python3 tools/geojson2overpass.py roads.geojsonseq overpass.json
  # 3. → the tile block (native; writes an mmap store)
  loft --native-release --lib lib tools/gen-tiles.loft <region>.tiles overpass.json
  # 4. OSM snapshot date for the attribution (PLAN-APP §11)
  osmium fileinfo -e -g data.timestamp.last <region>.osm.pbf
  ```
  (`parse_ways` reads **Overpass-JSON**, not geojsonseq — step 2 is required. Verify counts: soverijssel
  = 1215 tiles / 229,117 roads.)
- **`tools/build-blocks.sh` does not exist yet** — scripting the above per-block (with the snapshot
  stamp + top index) is PLAN-APP Track C/2 work (steps F3/F4). Writing it activates the data-refresh
  workflow and Benelux/WE generation.

---

## 6. Environment to resume

- **loft** as a sibling checkout at `../loft`, built: `cargo build --release` (needs **mold** on Linux;
  `export SDKROOT=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)` on macOS). Point the app at it via `LOFT=../loft/target/release/loft`.
  - ⚠ The local `../loft` here is at #518 (has the #521 bug). For **wasm runtime** work, check out loft
    **before #518** (or wait for #521's fix). For the wasm **build/rlib**: `rustup target add wasm32-wasip2`
    then `cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip2 --lib --no-default-features --features random`.
- **Build/test/run:** `export SDKROOT=…` (mac); `make build`, `make test`, `make run`. CI mirrors this.
- **Browser packaging (Track 1) needs, and this environment lacked:** **node** + **jco** (wasm-bindgen
  transpile of the kernel) + a **browser** to run. wasmtime is enough for headless wasm (but #521 blocks
  the run right now).

---

## 7. Next steps (from PLAN-APP §10/§11)

Do in this order; **O** and the doc/tooling are done or in-flight.

1. **Merge PR #8** (CI note) — trivial.
2. **Track C — data-access core** (headless): `codec.loft` (C1 writer / C2 decoder — a **byte codec**,
   because `store_persist_bind` mmap does **not** load in wasm), block **directory** (C4), working-set
   **resolver** (C5), range loader over #517 (C6). *Caveat:* C3 "prove under wasmtime" needs a
   **pre-#518 loft** until loft#521 is fixed (the decode+match logic itself is testable natively now).
3. **F1/F2 (data freshness)** — stamp `osm_snapshot` in `gen-tiles.loft` + top index; show "data as of …"
   in the app attribution.
4. **Track 1 — browser app** (needs node/jco/browser): transpile kernel → browser wasm, rewire the
   Leaflet UI from WebSocket → wasm, whole-file fetch of one block, IndexedDB, deploy to Pages
   (unlisted URL for the selected group).
5. **Track 2 — Benelux**: `tools/build-blocks.sh` (F3) → generate blocks → top index → Release hosting
   (verify cross-origin CORS/Range) → working-set range loading. Enable the data-refresh cron (F4).
6. **Track 3 — Western Europe**: more blocks + cross-block stitching + LRU.

---

## 8. Gotchas / things that cost time (don't relearn these)

- **`store_persist_bind` is native-only** — returns `false` and reads/writes nothing under wasm (no
  mmap in wasip2). The browser must fetch+decode bytes (a codec), not map the store. (PLAN-APP §3, verified.)
- **loft#513 changed the store format** — any `.tiles` from an older loft reads *empty*; always
  regenerate after updating loft.
- **`parse_ways` eats Overpass-JSON, not geojsonseq** — hence `tools/geojson2overpass.py`.
- **loft#521**: every `--native-wasm` program aborts at runtime under any wasmtime (43 and 46) — it's the
  #518 thread-spawn, **not** a wasmtime version; a wasmtime pin does not help.
- **`make test` needs** node 22 (global `WebSocket`), `fuser` (psmisc), and creates `scratch/` itself.
  `make test-wasm` needs wasmtime.
- **CI builds loft from source** (no public binary); it caches on loft's HEAD sha and builds both the
  host binary and the wasip2 rlib.
- **Scratch is ephemeral** — anything under the session scratchpad (old experiments, the netherlands
  `.pbf`, intermediate `.tiles`) is gone on a new machine. The pipeline is now in `tools/`.

## 9. Loose ends

- CI wasm-parity gate is informational until loft#521 is fixed (then re-block it).
- `tools/build-blocks.sh` unwritten → data-refresh workflow dormant, Benelux/WE not yet generated.
- #517 not merged upstream → browser range reads pending.
- Elevation `h` in tiles is currently 0 (gen-tiles sets `h: 0`); needed for gradient/bike/climb
  (PLAN-ROUTING) — populate from terrarium at generation.
